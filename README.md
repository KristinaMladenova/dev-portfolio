##Linvs work-in-progress Portfolio. 

This year I embarked on the journey to design and create a portfolio website that merges my passion for nostalgic web design with my career as a graphic designer. The project involves using simple concepts in CSS to create beautiful illustrative designs and effects. I wanted to challenge myself to go back to the simple way of making websites but this time in React, a popular front-end framework.

The reason why I wanted to create this portfolio website is to showcase my skills and highlight my work in a unique and creative way, by using key concepts of visual communication and theory of Art and Color I wanted to create visually appealing assets that appeared to be "popping out" of the screen - Virtually merging the 2D world with the 3D environment in front of it. 

I believe that a portfolio website is a crucial component of any creative career, and I wanted mine to stand out from the rest. With my love for pixel art and nostalgic web design, I aimed to create a website that not only showcases my design work but also evokes a sense of nostalgia and excitement for the early days of the internet. While using React allowed me to create a dynamic and responsive website, I wanted to maintain the simplicity and charm of early web design by focusing on borders, colors, and finding creative ways to achieve textures with pure CSS manipulation. I needed to find a way to merge these two styles seamlessly, without compromising on either.
