After falling in love with their mission of helping students reach their highest potential, I volunteered for the past year (mandate 2022/23) as both a member of the Local LC Skopje board of operations and as a designer for various events. In addition to promotional materials (flyers, posters, social media posts), I have also designed physical products (hoodies, t-shirts).",
