      "As a member of EESTEC's Local LC Skopje board of operations and a designer for various events, I have been able to contribute to the organization's mission of empowering electrical engineering and computer science students at European universities and institutions to reach their full potential. In my volunteer role, I have created promotional materials such as flyers, posters, and social media posts, as well as physical products like hoodies and t-shirts. My work with EESTEC over the past year (mandate 2022/23) has been extremely rewarding and has allowed me to develop my skills as a designer while making a positive impact in the community.",

      "I discovered my passion for web development at a young age while playing with Chatango, a chatroom builder that introduced me to HTML and CSS. I was inspired by the design trends of the early 2010s and sought to bring a sense of magic and whimsy to my projects, including the use of a bubble cursor. I have continued to hone my skills in web development and am excited to share more about my experiences through the case study of one of my projects. ",
